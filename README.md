# Welcome to the Cache Eviction Algorithms Visualizer!

This project was created by Elizabeth Ruggiero for the Princeton University computer science independent work seminar COS IW 04. The goal of this website is to teach cache eviction algorithms in a visual and interactive way to help students more easily learn them. This website focuses on teaching three algorithms: first in first out (FIFO), least frequently used (LFU), and least recently used (LRU). This project can be viewed at https://ejruggiero.github.io/cache-eviction-algorithms/ as it was deployed to GitHub Pages.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deploy React app to GitHub Pages
To deploy the react app to GitHub Pages, run the command "npm run deploy" after you have pushed all of your code to the remote repository.

## Testing
To perform testing, add the line "type": "module" to package.json. Then, navigate to the tests folder and run "node fifoTest.js", "node lfuTest.js", or "node lruTest.js".

## Thanks
Special thanks to my professor Dr. Robert Fish and my teaching assistant Drew Curran for their help and guidance!
