    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Through this interactive visualization, you will learn three important cache eviction algorithms: first in first out (FIFO),
     least recently used (LRU), and least frequently used (LFU). As their names imply; the earliest element added to the cache is evicted in <b>FIFO</b>, the least recently added/accessed element is evicted in <b>LRU</b>, and the least frequently accessed element is evicted in <b>LFU</b>. It is recommended to first practice FIFO, then LRU, then LFU.</p>
    <p>Change the algorithm you wish to practice by toggling the dropdown <img src={dropdown} alt="Dropdown" width={250} height={40}/> at the top of the screen.</p>
    <p>The cache is represented by a gray rectangle <img src={cache} alt="Cache" width={100} height={25}/> near the center of the screen. It has a capacity of 5 data elements, and <b>a data element is first added to the cache before the one to its right.</b> Data elements are represented as yellow circles containing emojis 
     which represent their data. <img src={dataElem} alt="Data Element" width={50} height={50}/></p>
     <p>The data element to the left of the cache represents an incoming data element <img src={incomingElem} alt="Incoming Data Element" width={50} height={50}/> that we want to add to the cache. <b>If it matches an element in the cache,</b> then click on that matching element in the cache. This is known as a <b>hit</b> -- the data is successfully retrieved from the cache. <b>If the incoming element does not match any element in the cache,</b> then click the element that should be evicted from the cache based on the eviction algorithm you have chosen.</p>
     <p>Your score can be found at the top right corner of the screen.‚≠ê If you select the correct element to remove from the cache, then you will 
     gain 1 point.</p>
     <p>You can reopen this popup at any time by clicking on the Help button. <img src={help} alt="Help" width={70} height={50}/></p>
